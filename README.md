# hexField
a hexfield test for openframe.io developed with openframeworks, using https://github.com/jmwohl/Openframe-OF

openframe.io os an opensource art frame project which uses a raspberry pi to drive a monitor, and web access to change artworks.

As a concept and idea this works very well, and for a gallery setting with minimal equipment availability (ie: lack of computers for each artwork) using an inexpensive computer like the Raspberry Pi can make a huge difference.

Openframe.io can use multiple formats, and the usual suspects (images, gifs, movies, shaders) are included, but you can download others (tanagram, openframeworks)

As a small cohort of people there is not as much development as some of the larger open source projects on the web, but the digital artwork frame is a growning market.

These hexfield experiments are to satisfy two goals for myself. One is to test my programming acumen for an alternative platform, the raspberry pi as opposed to macosx. The other is to test the resiliency of openframe.io for continued projects.

Since these are experiments, please be aware of their possible limitations. They may not work within the context of the openfram.io project, and I will endeavor to remove the ones I find problematic. 

You will need the openframeworks extension for openframe.io. You may get that here: https://github.com/jmwohl/Openframe-OF
